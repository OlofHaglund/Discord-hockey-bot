This project is tracked in the Rota folder above.

## Testing
When asked to test or run the bot, rebuild the container first (`./podman.sh build`), then run it with Podman (e.g., `./podman.sh run`) rather than running the Python file directly.

Use the Developer Role by reading `~/Documents/General/00 - Rota/Roles/Developer.md`.
